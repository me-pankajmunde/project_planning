# Project Planning Agents

Welcome to the Project Planning Agents project, a cutting-edge AI system designed to streamline and optimize project planning and management. This project leverages the power of multi-agent systems to provide a comprehensive and efficient solution for project planning.

## Overview

The Project Planning Agents system consists of multiple autonomous agents, each responsible for a specific aspect of project planning. These agents work together to provide a holistic and integrated approach to project planning, ensuring that all aspects of the project are carefully considered and optimized.

## Agents

The following agents are part of the Project Planning Agents system:

* **Project Manager Agent**: responsible for overseeing the entire project planning process and ensuring that all agents are working together seamlessly.
* **Resource Allocation Agent**: responsible for allocating resources such as personnel, equipment, and materials to tasks and projects.
* **Task Scheduling Agent**: responsible for scheduling tasks and projects based on dependencies, priorities, and resource availability.
* **Risk Management Agent**: responsible for identifying and mitigating potential risks and issues that may impact the project.
* **Communication Agent**: responsible for facilitating communication and collaboration among team members and stakeholders.

## Features

The Project Planning Agents system provides the following features:

* **Automated project planning**: the system can automatically generate project plans based on input parameters and constraints.
* **Resource optimization**: the system can optimize resource allocation to minimize waste and maximize efficiency.
* **Task scheduling**: the system can schedule tasks and projects based on dependencies and priorities.
* **Risk management**: the system can identify and mitigate potential risks and issues.
* **Collaboration and communication**: the system can facilitate communication and collaboration among team members and stakeholders.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Project Planning Agents system, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies: `crewai install`
2. Configure the system: modify the files from `config` folder to set up the agents and their parameters.
3. Run the system on local env: `crewai run`

## Configuration

The agents can be configured by modifying the agents and tasks files from `config` folder. The following parameters can be set:

* `project_manager_agent`: settings for the Project Manager Agent.
* `resource_allocation_agent`: settings for the Resource Allocation Agent.
* `task_scheduling_agent`: settings for the Task Scheduling Agent.
* `risk_management_agent`: settings for the Risk Management Agent.
* `communication_agent`: settings for the Communication Agent.
